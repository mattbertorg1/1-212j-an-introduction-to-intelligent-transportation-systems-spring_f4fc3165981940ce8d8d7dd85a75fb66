Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) represent a major transition in transportation on many dimensions. This course considers ITS as a lens through which one can view many transportation and societal issues. ITS is an international program intended to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of surface transportation systems through advanced technologies in information systems, communications, and sensors. In the United States, ITS represents the major post-Interstate-era program for advancing surface transportation in highways and public transportation, and is potentially comparable to the air traffic control system in impact. The readings for the class come primarily from the instructor's own text: Sussman, Joseph. [_Perspectives on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS)_](http://www.springeronline.com/sgw/cda/frontpage/0,11855,4-40109-22-35352196-0,00.html). New York, NY: Springer, 2005. ISBN: 0387232575.
